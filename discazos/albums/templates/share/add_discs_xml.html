  <h1>Sharing your Discazo with the community</h1> 
  <h2>Step 2 of 5: Add discs to the album</h2>
  <p>Next step consist in adding the audio disc (or discs, if it has 2 or 3) 
    to the album. To achive this easily, we have made a desktop application 
    which will help you to complete the process. It will create 2 files: One 
    text file containing basic disc information and another audio MP3 file with 
    all album songs ready to upload (in the last step of this assistant).</p>
  <p>So, download
    <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}downloads/discazos-creator/discazos-creator-latest.deb">
      Discazos Creator (Ubuntu only)</a>
    and follow the assistant to generate 
    these files, based on your CD or MP3 files of the album.</p>
  <p>When finished, upload below the Discazo XML file generated by the 
    program, containg basic discs information.</p>
